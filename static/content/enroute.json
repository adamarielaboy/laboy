If you’re spending money on the trip, might as well take the best out of it! But sometimes traveling is fragmented. From the moment we start researching, we open a million tabs, store the findings in notes, email, or an online shareable document. At the destination, we rely on a GPS and previous experiences. What are the takeaways after the trip is completed? Do we remember what we were looking for? What those memories look like in a week? A month? A year? It fades away… and we’d like to avoid that.",
